# tyggbot

tyggbot is a twitch chat bot created by [pajlada](http://twitch.tv/pajlada), which runs in [tyggbar's](http://twitch.tv/tyggbar) chat.

## Quick install

1. Install library requirements by typing `pip install -r pip-requirements.txt` in the root folder
2. Create a database with tables according to `install/db.sql`
3. Copy `install/config.example.ini` to `./config.ini` and change the relevant lines in the file.
4. Run the bot! `./main.py`

## Disclaimer

The code is most likely messy and ugly, this is my first "full scale" python project.
